# copyapp <src> <dst>
#
# This script is used to copy the database and assets from one Heroku
# application to another. It is run nightly to sync the staging instance with
# the production database and media.
#
# In addition to the command line arguments, which should be the names of Heroku
# applications, the command also modifies its behaviour in response to the
# setting of two environment variables:
#
#   DRYRUN - If DRYRUN is set to a nonblank value, then the command won't
#            perform any actions, but instead will print details of what it
#            would do.
#
#   QUIET - If QUIET is set to a nonblank value, the command will not print
#           any output except in the event that an error is encountered. This is
#           suitable for use when running the script as a cronjob.
